# MediChat: An AI-Powered Medical Consultation Assistant

## Project Overview  
MediChat is an intelligent medical consultation chatbot designed to specialize in healthcare conversations. It uses the Llama3.1:8B model, fine-tuned with the unsloth dataset, to deliver contextually relevant and accurate responses. The interface is built using Streamlit for a seamless user experience.

The model is based on Llama3.1:8B ([Llama3.1 Model Link](https://huggingface.co/huggingdaveTest1/unsolt_Llama)), which has been further fine-tuned using the [ChatDoctor-HealthCareMagic-100k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lavita/ChatDoctor-HealthCareMagic-100k) dataset. This fine-tuning enhances the model's ability to handle healthcare-related queries effectively.

## Disclaimer  
This model is created as part of a job application test and is intended for research, experimentation, and deployment. It is **not** suitable for providing medical advice, diagnosing conditions, or making treatment recommendations.
